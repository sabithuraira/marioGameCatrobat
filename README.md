GSOC'24 @Catrobat. Aim to develop an awesome tutorial game using Catrobat visual programming language.

### Awesome Demo Game Project üéÆ 

# ‚≠êüåü‚≠ê _Super Mario Bros Demo Game Project_ ‚≠êüåü‚≠ê



## Introduction <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
Super Mario Bros is a popular 2D action game for the Nintendo game where players take control of the main character by running, jumping, bowing and shooting at their enemy. The mission of the game is to rescue the Princess from the main enemy character Bowser King of the Koopa. 

### Aim and Future Objectives üåç
Catrobat aspires to develop solutions which inspire teenagers and adults to learn coding, get creative and be prepared for the digital world of our future. We are doing this by bypassing traditional school pedagogy, instead using a constructionist approach focusing on game app development and fun. We believe in poverty alleviation through coding education for teens ‚Äì girls in particular, refugees, and teens in developing countries, directly on their personal smartphones. This is especially important in less privileged regions, where teenagers have their own smartphones but do not have access to PCs, laptops, or tablets.

## Project Summary üîÆ
The game will adopt the ‚ÄúSuper Mario Bros‚Äù game however it will not display exactly the same game.

## Game Story üíû
There are some reasons why I create the different game, including:
‚óè Different methods I think fit for code on the Pocket Code platform. While developing an application on a platform like a desktop using IDE, we can handle bigger code than when we do it on the mobile platform. We will change some of the flow of the game but still give the same experience when we play the ‚ÄúSuper Mario Bros‚Äù game.
‚óè We want players to feel unpredictable challenges in the game.
‚óè We will make less level so maybe we will increase the difficulty level on the game

Based on these reasons, the storyboard changes that will be made are as follows:

‚óè Different Obstacles and Enemies

The game will not set the same obstacle as the ‚ÄúSuper Mario Bros‚Äù Nintendo game, but it will show different obstacles and enemies position. For example when we play the existing game, players always know what kind of obstacles and enemies they will face in every position. When we make random positions for obstacles and enemies, it will make players focus on the game.


‚óè Same Level of Difficulty

Even though the game displays different obstacles and enemies positions, we will have the same level of difficulty. For example if in an existing game players will face 5 enemies, in this game they will face 5 enemies too, but in random locations.

‚óè Main Enemy In Every Level

Players will face the Main Enemy character before they reach the end of every level.


## Initial Plan üìà
I chose Awesome Demo Game Project (350Hr) from the idea list. The project appealed to my skill set and my interest to design addictive storyline games. Pocket Code and Catrobat visual programming language provide clear-cut tools for the development of large gaming projects. I choose to clone legend "Super Mario Bros" game because I think it can make much people interest with the game. These games have the power to encapsulate your attention throughout the story and make you smile after a tiresome day. Features like cloning, saving data, fetching requests, handling motion, and touch sensing! All are compressed in a single block. Even with a low coding experience, complex game features can be introduced which excited me. Hence, I chose this idea. It provided me a way to pour out my imagination and showcase the beauty of Pocket Code to the world, motivating enthusiastic developers to overcome the coding barrier and enter this field.

## Overall Experience üèÜ
Getting an opportunity to learn and implement a whole new skill is always challenging and full of learning. Gaming has always been an integral part of a teenager's life. Hence, spending my summer transforming a creative idea into an actual technical game was a great experience. 
Visual coding languages have brought a revolution in the field of coding. Google and Catrobat allowed me to explore this beautiful field. 

Apart from all the fun, the challenges must be acknowledged too. 

‚óè Found an interesting idea so that the admin org can accept me as a participant in gsoc 2024
‚óè Make details of the ideas that have been created including initial flow, story board, schedule setting, and documentation were new for me (for game project) but the sessions from google and guidance from org admins and mentors made the boarding smooth and it became easy thereafter. Over the next few weeks, a consistent flow was set and the development went smoothly.

‚óè Collect assets from various sources.

‚óè Implement the logic and nature of each character, including the logic in each interaction between characters.

‚óè Solving issues found in application development. I regularly discuss the problems I encounter with my mentor and he really helps me solve the problems I encounter during application development.

Thank you mentors Aakash Tyagi, Dev Sebastian and Catrobat for the support. From the very first interaction during the initial phase to regular communication with my mentors, the experience has been smooth and friendly. I feel grateful to be part of this community.


## Contributing to the Project ü§≥üèª
The project files (.catrobat files) created during this summer are uploaded. All the assets are accordingly uploaded under :assets: folder. 
The(.catrobat) file can be imported into your Pocket Code app.

To see the game development history from both video and source code perspectives, you can see the link provided in this description.

Download the desired project file and remix it as you want!
